#The-Shape-of-Film
<h1>The Shape of Film</h1>
<p>The purpose of this excercise is to explore film narratives based on Kurt Vonnegut's rejected Master's Thesis, 'The Shape of All Stories'. In Vonnegut fasion, he stated that "The fundamental ideais that stories have shapes which can be drawn on graph paper, and that the shape of a given societyâ€™s stories is at least as interesting as the shape of its pots or spearheads."</p>
<br>
<p>This was further examined by the University of Vermont, where over 2,000 literary works were examined, producing six basic shapes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rags to Riches (rise)</li>
  <li>Riches to Rags (fall)</li>
  <li>Man in a Hole (fall then rise)</li>
  <li>Icarus (rise then fall)</li>
  <li>Cinderella (rise then fall then rise)</li>
  <li>Oedipus (fall then rise then fall)</li>
  <h2>Riches to Rags</h2>
 </ul>
<p>I addionally added 'Lifelike Ambiguity', as originally mentioned by Vonnegut, and 'Miscellaneous' to consider abstract films with nonlinear narratives and documentaries where this also may apply. I'll be comparing the Top 250 movies as published by Sight & Sound magazine (British Film Institute), IMDB Top 250 User Rated movies, and the top movies by box office gross.</p>
